# Meta-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first creation using html, css, and javascript together to make a website.
The goal of Meta Tic Tac Toe is the same as normal tic tac toe... Win!
, but to win you need to win three entire games of tic tac toe in a row.

The game only has a front end, so there is no saved data for the wins or losses at the moment.

## Variations

You can play with the square assignment for the active square being choosen by the player who just placed a x or o,
or make it random. Random tends to go faster, but player choosen makes it more strategic.

## Future ideas

* Back end for saving wins/losses
* AI component
